            "1. \"Article\" is incorrectly spelled as \"acticle.\"\n",
            "2. There is unnecessary usage of the word \"only\" which makes the sentence a bit awkward.\n",

            "\n",
            "In this revision, the sentence is simplified and made more concise. Misunderstanding implies that you're not getting the original idea, so the sentence doesn't need to further specify that the idea you're understanding is not the original one. \"Might\" is used instead of \"will,\" suggesting possibility instead of certainty given that misunderstanding might not always occur. It's also more direct and natural to say \"the idea in that article\" rather than '\"some misunderstood idea about that article.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "2. In the latter part of the sentence, it's more appropriate to use 'and' instead of repeating 'be able to'. It makes the sentence more concise and avoids redundancy.\n",
            "\n",
